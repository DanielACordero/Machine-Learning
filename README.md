# Machine-Learning and K-Means clustering 
We received a csv with 5235 songs, with information on attributes each song has, as well as artist name, And a html link. 
The task in hand was to clean the data, in a way where it is possible to treat it, group it and then put it through the pipeline, of the spotify API. 
To be able to create playlists from the clusters made with K-means clusters. 
To be able to get as far as that, there was a lot of name issues, float vs string issues as well as scaling the massive amount of information. 
Make plots showing the correlation between each attribute, to make the decision of what "fits" together. 
The task at hand was a tedious one, as me being a beginner i had a lot of errors that I didnt know how to solve starting this task. 
I cleaned the information, fed it through k-means to create clusters and then put it through the spotify APIs to then receive selection of tracks.
